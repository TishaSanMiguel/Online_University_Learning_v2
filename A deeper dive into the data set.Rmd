## A deeper dive into the data set
Open Univeristy Learning provides a rich set of data <https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset#rights>.

What important fields and information does the data set have?
Courses: modules, when they were given and how long they lasted.
Assessments: type of assessment performed on the courses, when the assessment was performed during the module, and the weight of the assessment.
Student information: demographics but mainly number of attempts at the module, current number of credits being taken and the final result.
Student registration: marks if the student dropped out of the module.
Student VLE: number of times a student interacts with the module.

## What kind of cleaning and wrangling did you need to do?
I used filter and select for the columns I needed.  
I re-named terms that might not be clear to the reader with mutate() .  
I used plot() and hist() for quick visualization.  
Dim() and glimpse() were used to check the dataframe.

## Any preliminary exploration youâ€™ve performed and your initial findings?
I have found that less than half of the students did not pass their courses.

## Based on these findings, what approach are you going to take? How has your approach changed from what you initially proposed, if applicable?
My intial proposal was to find ways to retain students but so far I have only found how many students have actually passed.  I still have to trace back my findings to the type and weight of the assessment and to the number of times the students engaged with the course (sum_click).  I would also like to find if the individual students have improved over the course of the semesters.
